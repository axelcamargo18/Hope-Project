an API created by us in our website.

About IEPO
(International Energy Power Organization)
IEPO is a News Organization Website designed to inform the world in just one place
without the need to research multiple news platforms to know about the latest updates
of energy prices worldwide. IEPO additionally is compromised with informing the public
of the different incentives available for establishing renewable energy in buildings and
other organizations that offer help in ending energy poverty around the world.
Important Information on how the website was created
‚óè For the database requirement we created a Newsletter form that sends the
website user's email to our local database. MySQL was used as our database
management system which was connected to Node.Js.
‚óè For the 3rd Party API requirement we used RapidAPI Energy Price News API.
To display the 3rd Party API in our front end we used the Fetch API. The
requests for the articles, regions and sources were located in folders to be more
organized.
‚óè For the creation of the 1st Party API requirement we used Node.Js to create a
local server and a JSON file which contains sources of organizations and
incentives with the following information: name, a link to their website, and link to
their logo image to be displayed in our website.

Difficulties with the project
‚óè As always collaborative projects can be complicated due to working in different
branches.
‚óè One of the hardest parts was figuring out a solution to display the 3rd Party API
on the client side of the website due to it being our first time working alone with
3rd Party APIs but we managed to displayed them correctly.
